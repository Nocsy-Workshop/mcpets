AdvancedPet is a plugin meant to setup advanced modeled pets for your server.
The plugin relies on MythicMobs & ModelEngine to create your pet, maybe add it some skills and specific behaviors so that it get useful for the players or do some tricky stuff.
AdvancedPet offers an GUI interface to spawn the pet and manage them (change their name, mount them, revoke them).
It also ensures the pet to behave like one : whatever is configured inside MythicMobs, you can configure each pet with AdvancedPet to come back to the player when it gets too far, or get teleported instead if it's completely lost.
Also, AdvancedPet provides the opportunity to cast a skill before your pet gets to despawn, that can be used to cast despawning animations and more !

The plugin is still in BETA, so make sure to report any bug you encounter while staying indulgent please.

Want to try the plugin ? You can go on the DEMO server of Littleroom at : play.littleroom.dev
